    A container element with a dropped shadow, based on Quasar's QCard component.

    This element provides a container with a dropped shadow. It can be used to display
    various types of content, such as images, text, or other elements.

    Note:
    There are subtle differences between the Quasar component and this element.
    In contrast to this element, the original QCard has no padding by default and hides
    outer borders of nested elements. If you want the original behavior, use the `tight`
    method. If you want the padding and borders for nested children, move the children
    into another container.

    Usage:
    ```python
    card = Card()
    card.add_child(Text('Hello, world!'))
    card.add_child(Image('image.jpg'))
    ```
