class FilterElement(Element):
    """
    Represents a filter element that can be bound to another object's property.

    This element allows you to bind its `filter` property to a target object's property,
    enabling two-way synchronization of the filter value.

    Usage:
    1. Create an instance of `FilterElement`.
    2. Optionally, set the initial filter value using the `filter` parameter in the constructor.
    3. Bind the filter to a target object's property using the `bind_filter_to` or `bind_filter_from` methods.
    4. Optionally, use the `bind_filter` method to establish a two-way binding.
    5. Update the filter value using the `set_filter` method.
    6. Implement the `_handle_filter_change` method to handle filter changes.

    Example:
    ```
    filter_element = FilterElement(filter='example')
    filter_element.bind_filter_to(target_object, target_name='filter')
    filter_element.set_filter('new_filter')
    ```

    Args:
        filter (str, optional): The initial filter value. Defaults to None.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the base class constructor.
