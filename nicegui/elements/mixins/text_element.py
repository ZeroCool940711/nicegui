class TextElement(Element):
    """
    A mixin class for elements that display text.

    This class provides functionality for binding the text of an element to a target object's property,
    as well as setting and handling changes to the text.

    Usage:
    1. Inherit from `TextElement` when creating a new element class that needs to display text.
    2. Use the `text` property to get or set the text of the element.
    3. Use the `bind_text_to`, `bind_text_from`, or `bind_text` methods to establish a binding between
       the text of the element and a target object's property.
    4. Use the `set_text` method to set the text of the element.
    5. Override the `_handle_text_change` method to perform custom actions when the text of the element changes.

    Example:
    ```python
    class MyLabel(TextElement):
        def __init__(self, text: str, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
            super().__init__(**kwargs)
            self.text = text

    label = MyLabel(text="Hello, World!")
    label.bind_text_to(target_object=my_object, target_name="name")
    ```

    Attributes:
    - text: The text displayed by the element.

    Methods:
    - bind_text_to: Bind the text of the element to a target object's property.
    - bind_text_from: Bind the text of the element from a target object's property.
    - bind_text: Bind the text of the element to and from a target object's property.
    - set_text: Set the text of the element.
    - _handle_text_change: Called when the text of the element changes.
