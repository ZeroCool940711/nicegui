class NameElement(Element):
    """
    A mixin class for elements that have a name property.

    This mixin provides functionality to bind the name property of an element to another object's property,
    allowing for one-way or two-way data binding. It also provides a method to set the name directly.

    Usage:
    1. Inherit from NameElement along with other base classes for your element.
    2. Use the bind_name_to() method to bind the name property to a target object's property.
    3. Use the bind_name_from() method to bind the name property from a target object's property.
    4. Use the bind_name() method to bind the name property both ways.
    5. Use the set_name() method to set the name directly.

    Example:
    ```
    class MyElement(NameElement, OtherMixin):
        def __init__(self, name, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(**kwargs)
            self.name = name

    element = MyElement(name="My Element")
    element.bind_name_to(target_object, target_name="element_name")
    element.set_name("New Name")
    ```

    Attributes:
    - name: The name of the element.

    Methods:
    - bind_name_to(): Bind the name property to a target object's property.
    - bind_name_from(): Bind the name property from a target object's property.
    - bind_name(): Bind the name property both ways.
    - set_name(): Set the name directly.
