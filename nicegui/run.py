    This function is used to execute a CPU-bound function in a separate process. It takes a callback function as the first argument,
    followed by any additional positional and keyword arguments that need to be passed to the callback function.

    Parameters:
        callback (Callable): The CPU-bound function to be executed in a separate process.
        *args (Any): Additional positional arguments to be passed to the callback function.
        **kwargs (Any): Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the callback function.

    Returns:
        Any: The result of the CPU-bound function execution.

    Notes:
        - The `cpu_bound` function needs to execute the callback function in a separate process.
        - To achieve this, it transfers the entire state of the callback function to the process using pickle.
        - It is recommended to create static methods or free functions that accept all the necessary data as simple parameters,
          rather than relying on class or UI logic, and return the result instead of modifying class properties or global variables.

    This function is used to execute I/O-bound functions in a separate thread, allowing the main event loop to continue
